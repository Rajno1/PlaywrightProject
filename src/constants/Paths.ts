/**
 * Path Constants
 * Centralized path management for test data and resources
 *
 * WHY __dirname instead of process.cwd()?
 *
 * process.cwd() returns the directory where the command was executed from.
 * This changes depending on the environment:
 *   - Running from VS Code terminal → might return a parent directory
 *   - Running from CI pipeline     → returns the pipeline working directory
 *   - Running via npm script       → returns project root (coincidentally correct)
 *
 * This inconsistency caused auth files to resolve to wrong paths,
 * making the fixture think no auth file existed and triggering
 * unnecessary re-logins or failures.
 *
 * __dirname always returns the absolute path of THIS file's directory,
 * regardless of where the command is run from. It is determined at
 * compile/load time, not runtime — so it never changes.
 *
 * This file lives at: src/constants/Paths.ts
 * So:
 *   __dirname              = .../PlaywrightProject/src/constants
 *   path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..') = .../PlaywrightProject  ← project root ✅
